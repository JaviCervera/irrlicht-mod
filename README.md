## 1. Directory Structure Overview

  You will find some directories after uncompressing the archive of the
  SDK. These are:

| Dir      | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| examples | Examples and tutorials showing how to use the engine with C++. |
| include  | Header files to include when programming with the engine. |
| media    | Graphics and sound resources for the demo applications and examples. |
| source   | The source code of the Irrlicht Engine. This code is not needed to develop applications with the engine, but it is included to enable recompilation and debugging, if necessary. |
| tools    | Useful tools (with sourcecode) for the engine. |

## 2. How to start

To see the engine in action in Windows, just go to the \bin\Win32-VisualStudio
directory, and start some applications. There should also be an
application named Demo.exe which should show the most
interesting features of Irrlicht.

To start developing own applications and games with the engine take
a look at the 01.HelloWorld example in the \examples directory.
There is also a .html file with a tutorial which should be
easily comprehensible.

The Irrlicht Engine is a static lib under linux. A precompiled version can be
generated from the sources using the Makefile in source/Irrlicht. Run 'make' in 
that subfolder. After this you should be able to 'make' all
example applications in /examples by calling the buildAllExamples script. You 
can run the examples then from the bin folder.

It is also possible to use Irrlicht as shared object
(libIrrlicht.so.versionNumber). Use the proper makefile target for this by
running 'make sharedlib' in the source folder. See the Makefile for details.

For OSX you can find an XCode project file in source/Irrlicht/MacOSX. This will
build the libIrrlicht.a library necessary to create the apps.

## 3. Requirements

You can use one of the following compilers/IDEs to develop applications
with Irrlicht or recompile the engine. However, other compilers/IDEs may
work as well, we simply didn't test them.

* gcc 4.x
* Visual Studio 2010(10.0)-2013(12.0)
* Code::Blocks (& gcc or visual studio toolkit)
  
If you ever want to (re)compile the engine yourself (which means you don't
want to use the precompiled version) you need the following:

* Windows:
  * Needed: PlatformSDK (which usually comes with all IDEs, download it separately for MSVC Express 2005)
  * Optional: DirectX SDK, for D3D9 support
  * Optional: DirectX SDK prior to May 2006, for D3D8 support
* Linux:
  * Needed: XServer with include files
  * Optional: OpenGL headers and libraries (libGL.so) for OpenGL support
    * GLX +
    * XF86VidMode [package x11proto-xf86vidmode-dev] or XRandr (X11 support libraries, the latter two for fullscreen mode)
* OSX:
  * Needed: XCode and Cocoa framework
  * Needed: OpenGL headers and libraries

## 4. Release Notes

Informations about changes in this new version of the engine can be
found in changes.txt.

Please note that the textures, 3D models and levels are copyright
by their authors and not covered by the Irrlicht engine license.

## 5. License

The license of the Irrlicht Engine is based on the zlib/libpng license.
Even though this license does not require you to mention that you are
using the Irrlicht Engine in your product, an acknowledgement
would be highly appreciated.

Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, and libpng. This means that if you use
the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere
in your documentation that you've used the IJG code and libpng. It would
also be nice to mention that you use the Irrlicht Engine and the zlib.
See the README files in the jpeglib and the zlib for
further informations.
